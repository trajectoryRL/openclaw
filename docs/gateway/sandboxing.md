# Sandboxing

Clawdbot can run **tools inside Docker containers** to reduce blast radius.
This is **optional** and controlled by configuration (`agent.sandbox` or
`routing.agents[id].sandbox`). If sandboxing is off, tools run on the host.
The Gateway stays on the host; tool execution runs in an isolated sandbox
when enabled.

This is not a perfect security boundary, but it materially limits filesystem
and process access when the model does something dumb.

## What gets sandboxed
- Tool execution (`bash`, `read`, `write`, `edit`, `process`, etc.).
- Optional sandboxed browser (`agent.sandbox.browser`).

Not sandboxed:
- The Gateway process itself.
- Any tool explicitly allowed to run on the host (e.g. `agent.elevated`).
  - **Elevated bash runs on the host and bypasses sandboxing.**
  - If sandboxing is off, `agent.elevated` does not change execution (already on host). See [Elevated Mode](/tools/elevated).

## Modes
`agent.sandbox.mode` controls **when** sandboxing is used:
- `"off"`: no sandboxing.
- `"non-main"`: sandbox only **non-main** sessions (default if you want normal chats on host).
- `"all"`: every session runs in a sandbox.

## Scope
`agent.sandbox.scope` controls **how many containers** are created:
- `"session"` (default): one container per session.
- `"agent"`: one container per agent.
- `"shared"`: one container shared by all sandboxed sessions.

## Workspace access
`agent.sandbox.workspaceAccess` controls **what the sandbox can see**:
- `"none"` (default): tools see a sandbox workspace under `~/.clawdbot/sandboxes`.
- `"ro"`: mounts the agent workspace read-only at `/agent` (disables `write`/`edit`).
- `"rw"`: mounts the agent workspace read/write at `/workspace`.

Inbound media is copied into the active sandbox workspace (`media/inbound/*`).

## Images + setup
Default image: `clawdbot-sandbox:bookworm-slim`

Build it once:
```bash
scripts/sandbox-setup.sh
```

Sandboxed browser image:
```bash
scripts/sandbox-browser-setup.sh
```

By default, sandbox containers run with **no network**.
Override with `agent.sandbox.docker.network`.

Docker installs and the containerized gateway live here:
[Docker](/install/docker)

## Tool policy + escape hatches
Tool allow/deny policies still apply before sandbox rules. If a tool is denied
globally or per-agent, sandboxing doesn’t bring it back.

`agent.elevated` is an explicit escape hatch that runs `bash` on the host.
Keep it locked down.

## Multi-agent overrides
Each agent can override sandbox + tools:
`routing.agents[id].sandbox` and `routing.agents[id].tools`.
See [Multi-Agent Sandbox & Tools](/multi-agent-sandbox-tools) for precedence.

## Minimal enable example
```json5
{
  agent: {
    sandbox: {
      mode: "non-main",
      scope: "session",
      workspaceAccess: "none"
    }
  }
}
```
